# seamless-improvements
Seamless's site is pretty bad. Seamless ratings are even worse. This Chrome extension utilizes outside data to improve the Seamless browsing experience.

* Foursquare restaurant ratings
* Yelp restaurant ratings _coming soon_
* FDA restaurant inspection codes _coming soon_

### Installation
1) You'll need to add your own Foursquare `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

2) ```git clone https://github.com/beng/seamless-improvements.git```

3) ```Chrome.app > Window > Extensions > Load unpacked extension... > Navigate to cloned repo```
