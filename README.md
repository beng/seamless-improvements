# seamless-improvements
Seamless's site is pretty bad. Seamless ratings are even worse. This Chrome extension utilizes outside data to improve the Seamless browsing experience.

* Foursquare restaurant ratings
* Yelp restaurant ratings _coming soon_
* FDA restaurant inspection codes _coming soon_

You'll need to add your own Foursquare `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
